== What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is the world's most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

== What's New

=== Bug Fixes

The following bugs have been fixed:

//* ws-buglink:5000[]
//* ws-buglink:6000[Wireshark bug]
//* cve-idlink:2013-2486[]
//* Wireshark always manages to score tickets for Burning Man, Coachella, and SXSW while you end up working double shifts. (ws-buglink:0000[])

* "On-the-wire" packet lengths are limited to 65535 bytes. (ws-buglink:8808[], ws-buglink:9390)
* "Follow TCP Stream" shows only the first HTTP req+res. (ws-buglink:9044[])
* Files with pcap-ng Simple Packet Blocks can't be read. (ws-buglink:9200[])

=== New and Updated Features

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since version 1.11.2:

* Qt port:

** The About dialog has been added
** The Capture Interfaces dialog has been added.
** The Decode As dialog has been added.
** Several SCTP dialogs have been added.
** The statistics tree (the backend for many Statistics and Telephony menu
items) dialog has been added.

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since version 1.11.1:

* Mac OS X packaging has been improved.

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since version 1.11.0:

* Dissector output may be encoded as UTF-8. This includes TShark output.

* Qt port:

** The Follow Stream dialog now supports packet and TCP stream selection.
** A Flow Graph (sequence diagram) dialog has been added.
** The main window now respects geometry preferences.


The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since version 1.10:

* Wireshark now uses the Qt application framework. The new UI should provide
  a significantly better user experience, particularly on Mac OS X and Windows.
* A more flexible, modular memory manger (wmem) has been added. It was available
  experimentally in 1.10 but is now mature and has mostly replaced the old API.
* Expert info is now filterable and now requires a new API.
* The Windows installer now uninstalls the previous version of Wireshark
  silently.  You can still run the uninstaller manually beforehand if you wish
  to run it interactively.
* The "Number" column shows related packets and protocol conversation spans
  (Qt only).
* When manipulating packets with editcap using the -C <choplen> and/or
  -s <snaplen> options, it is now possible to also adjust the original frame
  length using the -L option.
* You can now pass the -C <choplen> option to editcap multiple times, which
  allows you to chop bytes from the beginning of a packet as well as at the end
  of a packet in a single step.
* You can now specify an optional offset to the -C option for editcap, which
  allows you to start chopping from that offset instead of from the absolute
  packet beginning or end.
* "malformed" display filter has been renamed to "_ws.malformed".  A handful of
  other filters have been given the "_ws." prefix to note they are Wireshark
  application specific filters and not dissector filters.

=== Removed dissectors

* The ASN1 plugin has been removed as it's deemed obsolete.
* The GNM dissector has been removed as it was never used.

== Getting Wireshark

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
http://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

=== Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You can
usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system
specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be found
on the http://www.wireshark.org/download.html#thirdparty[download page]
on the Wireshark web site.

== File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference
files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations vary
from platform to platform. You can use Aboutâ†’Folders to find the default
locations on your system.
